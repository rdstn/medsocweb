            <h2>What is SwordClash?</h2>
            <p>SwordClash is the premier Medieval-themed event at the University of York! For three days this June, we will turn the university in a hub of exciting Medieval activity.
            the event will include a tournament, games, a market, martial arts (HEMA) seminars, academic talks and more! SwordClash has been graciously funded by the York Alumni association
            via the "YuFund" program, as well as by a number of charitable friends of the Medieval society, via the "YuStart" crowdfunding platform.
            </p>
            <p>
            SwordClash is the bigger and better version of our traditional summer tournament, an event for everyone at campus to enjoy. It's meant to be both educational and fun for everybody.

            <h2>Tickets?</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, not all our events are free. So, if you feel like coming to one of the workshops, talks or HEMA seminars, you'll have to book a spot.
        In general, all activities cost 3 pounds, payable at the door. Alternatively, you can book an event pass for 18 pounds or a day pass for 9!</p>
        <p>Due to class size constraints, the HEMA seminars require pre-booking. You can pay on the door, but you need to get your name in earlier. Use <a href="mailto:medieval@yusu.org?Subject=SwordClash%20HEMA" target="_top">this link</a> to pre-book a spot.</p>
