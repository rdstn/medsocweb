        <h2>What is SwordClash?</h2>
        <section><p>
            SwordClash is the premier Medieval-themed event at the University of York! For three days this June, we will turn the university in a hub of exciting Medieval activity.
            the event will include a tournament, games, a market, martial arts (HEMA) seminars, academic talks and more! SwordClash has been graciously funded by the York Alumni association
            via the "YuFund" program, as well as by a number of charitable friends of the Medieval society, via the "YuStart" crowdfunding platform.
            </p>
            <p>
            SwordClash is the bigger and better version of our traditional summer tournament, an event for everyone at campus to enjoy. It's meant to be both educational and fun for everybody.
